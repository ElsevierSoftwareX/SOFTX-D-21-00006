    """
    Computing cost function by penalizing prediction with area fraction 
    lower than 50% and rewarding for area fraction between 50% to 100%.

    Parameters
    ----------
    combined_user_data: array
        Distribution of user defined data for all characteristics.

    combined_predicted_data: array
        Distribution of predicted data for all characteristics.

    start_row_combined_data: list
        List comprising of row indexes of user and predicted data associated 
        with each characteristic to be optimized.

    data_dictionary: dictionary
        Dictionary consisting of complete data pertaining to characteristic to 
        be optimized. Keys used in the dictionary are integers used for

        '1': Number of neighbors
        '2': Grain boundary areas
        '3': Junction lengths
        '4': Junction angles in degrees
        '5a': Distance between grains as 1D array
        '5b': Distance between grains as matrix array
        '6': Disorientation angles
        '7': Type of grain boundaries
        '8': Schmid factors

    args: list
        Common arguments consisting of following:
            1. parameter_list
            2. dimension
            3. user_data
            4. start_row_of_parameter
            5. limit
            6. number_of_bins
            7. fig_animate
