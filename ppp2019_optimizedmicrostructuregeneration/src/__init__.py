# ## Main Program
# seed_array = np.array([[2.5, 5, 1], [7.5, 5, 1]])                   # Defining seed array
# limit = np.array([10, 10, 1])                                       # Defining limits array
# tessellation = create_tessellations(seed_array, limit)              # Calling the create_tessellations functions for performing voronoi create_tessellations
