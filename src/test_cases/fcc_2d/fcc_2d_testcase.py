        Grain 2 and grain boundary area.

    junction_lengths: List of lists
        List of lists consisting of column names: Sr. no., Junction type, 
        Junction lengths, grains with this junction.

    junction_angles_degrees: List of lists
        List of lists consisting of column names: Sr. No., Junction Type, 
        1st Junction angle, Grain containing the 1st junction angle, 
        2nd Junction angle, so on...

    distance_btw_grain_array: 2D array
        Symmetric array with rows and columns represented by grain numbers in 
        ascending order and each element of the array representing distance 
        between respective grain numbers.

        Grain no., Schmid factor, Slip plane and direction (Slip System).

    type_of_grain_boundaries: 2D array
        An array with the column names as grain 1, grain 2, rotation angle, 
        rotation axis, type of csl (0 indicates normal grain boundary).
