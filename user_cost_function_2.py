user_cost_function_2.py

Module to demonstrate an example of user-defined cost function.

This was created as part of "Personal Programming Project (PPP)" coursework in 
"Computation Materials Science (CMS)" M. Sc program at TU Bergakademie Freiberg,
Germany.

    seeds or vertices too far away from each other.
