    Generate seeds with FCC lattice type spacing in 2D.

    Processing
    ----------
    The function generates seeds in FCC lattice spacing in 2D and ensures 
    that there is no overlapping of seeds at the extreme ends of simulation box.

    Parameters
    ----------
    limit: array
        Size of simulation box (array of length along X, Y, Z directions)

    a: float
        Spacing between seeds along X, Y & Z in 3D case and along X & Y
        directions in Quasi-2D case. Also the spacing_length must be a perfect
        divisor of size of simulation box along all three directions.

    log_level: string
        Logger level to be used.

    Returns
    ------- 
    The function returns an array of regularly spaced seeds and also ensures 
    that the seeds are unique.
