        sizes.

    number_of_neighbor: 2D array
        An array comprising of data related to the number of 
        neighbors of each grains. Column names are: Grain number, number of 
        neighbors, grain indexes of neighbors.

    grain_boundary_area_distribution_ 2D array
        An array of consisting of columns Sr. No., Grain 1, 
        Grain 2 and grain boundary area.

    junction_lengths: List of lists
        List of lists consisting of column names: Sr. no., Junction type, 
        Junction lengths, grains with this junction.

    junction_angles_degrees: List of lists
        List of lists consisting of column names: Sr. No., Junction Type, 
        1st Junction angle, Grain containing the 1st junction angle, 
        2nd Junction angle, so on...

    distance_btw_grain_array: 2D array
        Symmetric array with rows and columns represented by grain numbers in 
        ascending order and each element of the array representing distance 
        between respective grain numbers.

    distance_btw_grain_1d: 1D array
        1D array of distances between grains

    disorientation_angle: 2D array

        angle, disorientation axis.

    schmid_factors: 2D array
        An array consisting of Schmid Factor related data with column names as 
        Grain no., Schmid factor, Slip plane and direction (Slip System).

    type_of_grain_boundaries: 2D array
        An array with the column names as grain 1, grain 2, rotation angle, 
        rotation axis, type of csl (0 indicates normal grain boundary).
