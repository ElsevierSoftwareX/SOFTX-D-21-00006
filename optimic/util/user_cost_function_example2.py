def mathematical_function(C, M, distArr, CritDist):
    """
    Compute cost based on mathematical formula dependent on exponential and 
    linear functions

    Parameters
    ----------

        '3': Junction lengths
        '4': Junction angles in degrees
        '5a': Distance between grains as 1D array
        '5b': Distance between grains as matrix array
        '6': Disorientation angles
        '7': Type of grain boundaries
        '8': Schmid factors

    args: list
        Common arguments consisting of following:
