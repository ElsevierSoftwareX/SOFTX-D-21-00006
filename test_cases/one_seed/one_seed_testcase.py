    Execute all assert statements related to one_seed_testcase.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tessellation: dictionary
        Dictionary of tessellations data with following keys:
            1. number_of_grains
            2. number_of_faces_list
            3. vertices_list
            4. face_vertices_list
            5. centroid_list
            6. volume_list
            7. normals_list
            8. neighbors_list
            9. face_area_list
            10. number_of_edges_list

    cell_number: integer
        Grain number.(Since only 1 grain, it must be always 0)

    size_of_simulation_box: array of length 3
        Size of simulation box (array of length along X, Y, Z directions)

    length_z: float
        Size of simulation box along Z axis.

    log_level: string
        Logger level to be used.

    Returns
    -------
    Function returns nothing.
