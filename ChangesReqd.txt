Required changes to code:
@auth: A. Prakash and Prince Henry Serrao
@date: 25.05.2020

* main.py
------------------
* line 32ff
- change to new command options

* import statements
- why not import as --> from abc import *

* Function header
- clearly mention each variable (both input and output), and its function

* Global variables --> do you really need them? Can you not avoid them?

- function cost_function, line 108ff --> can this be changed to numpy arrays/vectorization?

- why does the interpolation need to be done every time?

line 413 --> what does the comment refer to?
## Array of all the available texture information from the research paper

line 622ff - if else block can be easily avoided

TODO:
- command line options could be better/informative
- output formatting needs to be improved
- profiler must only be activated in the debug mode
- checking of libraries only to be done in the debug mode
- Speed is currently a significant concern!


* Unable to import functions from main.py directly from python
