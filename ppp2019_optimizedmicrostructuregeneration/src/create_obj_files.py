    The function creates a directory "obj_file_all_grains" if it doesnt 
    exist in the 'visualization_files' directorywithin appropriate

    Parameters
    ----------
    material_name: string
        Name of the material of which microstructure is being generated.
    
    tessellation: dictionary
        Dictionary consisting of data related to tessellations generated.
    
    store_folder: string
        Sub-directory name (output/output_test) in which output data would be
        stored. 
    
    face_flag: boolean
        Flag to specify if opaque surfaces are to be used instead of transparent.

    now: string
        Current time and date.
        
    skewed_boundary_flag: boolean
        Flag to specify if skewed grain boundaries are required. Only functional

    all_vertices_list: list
        List of vertices of skewed faces in appropriate sequence.
        
    log_level: string
        Logger level to be used.

    Output
    ------
    The functions saves OBJ file consisting of all the vertices and the line 
    connectivity data for all the vertices in the respective folder.
