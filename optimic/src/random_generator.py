    Generates random numbers within the ranges from 0 to respective length of 
    simulation box along specific axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    number_of_seeds: integer
        Number of seeds/grains

    dimension: integer 
        Dimension of study. (2 or 3)

    limits: array
        Size of simulation box (array of length along X, Y, Z directions)
    
    log_level: string
        Logger level to be used.

    Returns
    -------
    The function returns a list containing the coordinates of each seed.
