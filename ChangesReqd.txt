* main.py
------------------
* line 32ff
- change to new command options 
## Updated with new command options[completed on 06/07/2020] 

* import statements
- why not import as --> from abc import * 
## Updated with reason for such importing style as a comment block in main.py [completed on 07/07/2020]

* Function header
- clearly mention each variable (both input and output), and its function

* Global variables --> do you really need them? Can you not avoid them?
## Updated using Class to avoid use of Global variables [completed on 09/07/2020]

- function cost_function, line 108ff --> can this be changed to numpy arrays/vectorization?
## Updated [completed on 07/07/2020]

- why does the interpolation need to be done every time?
## Interpolation is needed to ensure same size of data set for comparison.

line 413 --> what does the comment refer to?
## Array of all the available texture information from the research paper
## Updated. It was a redundant line and i is now removed. [completed on 06/07/2020]

line 622ff - if else block can be easily avoided
## Updated [completed on 07/07/2020]

TODO:
- command line options could be better/informative
- output formatting needs to be improved
- profiler must only be activated in the debug mode			## Debug mode has been added. By default INFO log level is set. [completed on 09/07/2020]
- checking of libraries only to be done in the debug mode	## [completed on 09/07/2020]
- Speed is currently a significant concern!


* Unable to import functions from main.py directly from python
## Updated. The function 'main_run' and 'test_run' can now be imported and executed in any other python script. [completed on 17/07/2020] 

## Add left and right padding with zeros during optimization. [completed on 11/07/2020]

## Verified that Scipy Voronoi and Tess library creates same tessellations for same seed coordinates as input. [completed on 11/07/2020]

## Using Scipy Voronoi function to create tessellations to ensure that code is modular. [completed on 11/07/2020]
