    Generate seeds with HCP lattice type spacing in 3D.

    Processing
    ----------
    The function generates seeds in HCP lattice spacing in 3D and ensures 
    that there is no overlapping of seeds at the extreme ends of simulation box.

    Parameters
    ----------
    limit: array
        Size of simulation box (array of length along X, Y, Z directions)

    spacing_length: float
        Spacing between seeds along X direction. Spacing_length is a factor 
        multiplied to SQRT(3) in Y & Z directions in 3D case and along Y 
        directions in Quasi-2D case.

    log_level: string
        Logger level to be used.

    Returns
    ------- 
    The function returns an array of regularly spaced seeds and also ensures 
    that the seeds are unique.
